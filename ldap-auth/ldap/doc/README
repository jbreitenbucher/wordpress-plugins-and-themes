Description:
================================================================================

A plugin to override the core Wordpress MU authentication method so as to use an 
LDAP server for authentication.  

Once installed (see below for instructions), the system may be configured to 
automatically create local WordPress MU user accounts and blogs.  Both the 
automatic creation of users and the automatic creation of blogs are configurable
options.  

LDAP authentication is configured on a site-wide (as opposed to per-blog) level, 
so only Site Admin accounts have access to the configuration to LDAP connection 
information.    

Please make sure you have PHP compiled with LDAP support.  This will show up as 
an LDAP section in your phpinfo() if it is correct.

This plug-in has many authors (see Credits below).  If you make a modification 
to this plug-in, please consider submitting your changes as a patch to our 
SourceForge page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/wpmu-ldap.  

Remember - all the code for the plugin was contributed by volunteers, and you 
can show your gratitude by giving back to the community!


================================================================================
Installtion:
================================================================================

Extract to your <wordpressmu_root/wp-content/mu-plugins> folder.  Thats it!

It is recommended to also change the welcome message that is sent to users upon
account creation.  By default, WPMU includes the user's password in the message,
even though this password is *not* used by this plugin.  The password sent is
purely the password attached to the WPMU account that ties to the user's LDAP 
login.  To change the welcome message, log in as a Site Admin and go to Site
Admin -> Options, and edit "Welcome Email" appropriately.


================================================================================
Configuration:
================================================================================

Configuration of this plugin is on a site-wide level.  To modify its settings, 
you will need to be logged in to WPMU as a Site-Admin account and go to 
Site Admin -> LDAP Options

From here, you can configure the LDAP connection information, whether to 
automatically create "local" (read "WordPress MU") user accounts and blogs, 
whether the plugin is active or not, if the public signup form is enabled, and 
message to display if it is not.

For more information on each of the options available, install the plugin and 
check the LDAP Options panel; each option has hidden text containing helpful 
information and tips regarding the form inputs.

=== Creating Users / Blogs: ===
When enabled, this plugin can automatically create WordPress MU user accounts 
and blogs for LDAP-authenticated users.  Assuming user credentials authenticate
against the LDAP server, creating local accounts and blogs follows this 
algorithm:

Create a new WPMU User, with LDAP username and a randomly generated password.
Some user information, such as first and last name, is extracted from the 
  information returned from the LDAP server.
Actions for user creation and activation are triggered.
The user's domain / URL are created depending on plugin configuration (i.e., 
  VHost vs SubDir).
If the option is set, a blog is created, with path and name based on the LDAP 
  username and the blog is activated with the user being Administrator, and 
  appropriate actions are triggered.

It should be noted that even though a random password is created for a user (for 
WPMU accounts), it is never displayed to the user.  This is intentional so that 
there is no confusion as to which password should be used; it will always be 
using LDAP credentials.  As a result, though, if ever LDAP is disabled or if
the server is unavailable, users created with LDAP authentication will be 
unable to log in unless their passwords are reset.
